// Probability that a patient smokes and has cancer
Pmax1=? [ F (q0=1) & (q1=1) & (bc=1) ]

// Probability that a patient smokes and has heart disease
Pmax2 = ? [ F ((q0=1) & (q1=1) & (bh=1)) ]

// Probability that a person has cancer
Pmax=? [ F (bc=1) ]

For hyperproperty, check if Pmax1 == Pmax2
							Pmax1  > Pmax2
							Pmax1  < Pmax2
